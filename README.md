# line-chatbot
Following every bad practice there is to build a simple chatbot for Line app.
why?
simply I was given this task one "night" before its launch with no specific requirements for it.
something like this: "yo, we need a Line chatbot to do a survery for tomorrow".

I should have done a better job. But, oh well, didn't have free time to build it again so now I'm dealing with the consequences
by refactoring every now and then.

if you managed to read the whole thing without cringing to death, I salute you :)
